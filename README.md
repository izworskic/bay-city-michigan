# Bay City, Michigan — Chris Izworski

Resources and reflections on life, work, and community in Bay City and the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan.

## About

Bay City sits on the shore of Saginaw Bay, where the Saginaw River meets Lake Huron. It's a Great Lakes community with deep roots in lumbering, shipbuilding, and industry — and today it's a place where technology, emergency services, and agriculture intersect.

## Emergency Services

My career in emergency services spans both Bay County and Saginaw County:

- **Bay County Central Dispatch** — Former Director ([historical PSAP directory](https://npr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy/sites/wkar/files/201801/911_Dispatch_Centers_and_PSAPs_592540_7.pdf))
- **Saginaw County 911** — Former Executive Director ([Michigan PSAP Directory](https://www.michigan.gov/msp/-/media/Project/Websites/msp/CJIC/PDFs/911-Dispatch-Centers-and-PSAPs-POST.pdf))
- **Saginaw Area GIS Authority** — [Member representative](https://sagagis.org/member-representatives/) for 911 dispatch mapping systems
- **Saginaw County LEPC** — [Emergency planning coordination](https://saginawcountymi.gov/media/ydxj2jns/1-30-2025-local-emergency-planning-committee.pdf)

## Freighter View Farms

[Freighter View Farms](https://freighterviewfarms.com) is our gardening and seed saving project in Bay City — named for the Great Lakes freighters visible from the property. Zone 6a gardening, heirloom seeds, and seasonal observations from the shore of Saginaw Bay.
