# Bay City, Michigan — Writing by Chris Izworski

Bay City sits where the Saginaw River meets Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron. Great Lakes freighters pass through on their way to open water. The land is flat and dark and good for growing things.

## Freighter View Farms

Chris Izworski grows heirloom vegetables at [Freighter View Farms](https://freighterviewfarms.com) in Bay City — Zone 6a, heavy clay soil, lake-effect weather. The farm is named for the freighters visible from the garden on clear days.
